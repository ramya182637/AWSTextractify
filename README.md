# Textractify

**Textractify** is an intelligent, serverless cloud application designed to automate the extraction of text from uploaded scanned documents (PNG, JPG, or PDF) and deliver the output in `.txt` and `.csv` formats via secure email. The system leverages a fully AWS-based architecture to provide a scalable, efficient, and cost-effective solution.

## üîç Features

- Upload scanned documents via a web interface
- Extract text and data using **Amazon Textract**
- Receive output files (.txt and .csv) through email
- Secure access via time-limited pre-signed URLs
- Continuous monitoring, logging, and error reporting
- Auto-scaling infrastructure for performance and cost-efficiency

## üßë‚Äçüíº Target Users

- Businesses automating invoice/form processing
- Educational institutions digitizing documents
- Healthcare providers processing prescriptions and records
- Legal firms extracting data from contracts
- Developers integrating text extraction into workflows

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React (Dockerized) deployed via AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- **Backend**: Node.js on AWS Lambda
- **Storage**: Amazon S3 (input and output storage)
- **Text Extraction**: AWS Textract
- **API Layer**: AWS API Gateway
- **Notification**: Amazon SNS (email alerts)
- **Infrastructure as Code**: AWS CloudFormation
- **Monitoring**: Amazon CloudWatch + AWS SQS DLQ
- **Security**: AWS GuardDuty, IAM, AWS Secrets Manager

## üîÑ Flow of Execution

1. User accesses the frontend hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
2. User enters their email and selects a file (JPG, PNG, or PDF) to extract text from.
3. A request is sent to API Gateway which triggers a Lambda function to generate a pre-signed S3 upload URL.
4. The file is uploaded directly to S3 using the pre-signed URL, tagged with the email.
5. An S3 event triggers another Lambda function to start an AWS Textract job.
6. Textract processes the file and stores `.txt` and `.csv` outputs in another S3 folder.
7. The final S3 upload triggers a third Lambda function to send the results via email using Amazon SNS.
8. The email contains a shortened pre-signed download URL (valid for 1 hour).
9. CloudWatch and GuardDuty monitor and log events, with alerts and failures sent to DLQ or SNS as needed.
